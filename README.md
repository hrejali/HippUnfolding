# HippUnfolding
<<<<<<< HEAD

This provides all the tools to use Laplace's equation to computationally 'unfold' the grey matter of the hippocmapus. Note that at this stage the unfolding must be initialized using manual segmentations that separate the different 'folds' of hippocampal grey matter via the dark band, and extra-hippocampal structures must be delineated to mark boundary conditions  (see reference + supplementary materials).

Before using, be sure to follow these steps:

-Download Nifti_tools toolbox for MATLAB and add to path -Download toolbox_fast_marching toolbox for MATLAB. Also MEX the laplace_iters.m file using the contained project file. I also use the smooth2a.m function for nicer plots. 


=======
Laplace_unfold.m will perform the entire unfolding. Before using, be sure to follow these steps:

-Download Nifti_tools toolbox for MATLAB and add to path
-Download toolbox_fast_marching toolbox for MATLAB and add to path
-MEX the laplace_iters.m file (new filename laplace_iters_mex). This is not necessary, but speeds things up a lot!

Test it out on the example data using the command:

Laplace_unfold('example/EPI_V073.segmentation.rHPC.nii.gz')

<<<<<<< HEAD
This should produce a subfolder with visualizations of each Laplacian gradient in Nifti format, as well as a data.mat file containing all variables of interest.



The plot_UnfoldedSpace.m function will show an example of how the gradients stored in data.mat can be used to index and map intensities from an MRimage (in the same space as the segmentation image). For example, run

plot_UnfoldedSpace('EPI_V073.segmentation.rHPC_Unfolded','EPI_V073.T1overT2.avg4.nii.gz')

Note that avg_borders.mat contains the unfolded coordinates of each subfield border used in the following study:
